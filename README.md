### Install

This is currently for my personal use. I may push breaking changes at any time.

If you want to use it, bring down the code and run the following from the project's root directory:

`cargo install --path .`

That will install it in your `~/.cargo/bin/`

### Usage

Pass a `--category` and your `--note`.

You must have a `$HOME/notes/` directory (or set your own `<ROOT>`) and you need subdirectories with names matching the categories you want.

For each category, a file named `quick_notes.txt` will be created when you first use the category. After that, each note in that category will be appended to that file.
